# UC28881_Power_Module
Compact SIL-style power module based on Texas Instruments UC28881 controller, designed in KiCad
## Project Overview
 Design and simulate UC28881-based power supply.
 Verify operation through SPICE simulation in KiCad.
 Create a compact SIL-style PCB optimized for thermal performance and manufacturability.
 Generate Gerber, BOM, and documentation for production.
